# Bytecode Virtual Machine
This is a stack-based bytecode virtual machine developed in rust. It is an adventure in learning about computer architecture, language implementation, and as a platform to support my own programming language projects in the future. 
It will be the eventual target for my Flyt language, intended as a quick scripting language for small projects and automations, as well as a functional programming language with computer algebra support as the foundation and computation engine for a graphing calculator.
